<h1>Vanilla E-commerce Server API</h1>

This is the backend of [Vanilla E-commerce](https://github.com/muhhx/Vanilla-Ecommerce-Frontend)

It's a RESTful API built with NodeJS + Express + MongoDB that receives, process and delivers all the data from the frontend through Restful APIs.

## About this Project
- **Live website:** <https://vanillaec.herokuapp.com/>
- **Frontend repository:** <https://github.com/muhhx/Vanilla-Ecommerce-Frontend/>
  
The idea of the app was to build a place to share and curate my clothing interests from different brands and collections, so I came to the conclusion that there was no better way than to create a fully functional e-commerce application 😅.

The project includes Authentication, Payment methods, a Theme switcher, and various other functionalities that enhance the user experience, integrating it into third-party services like AWS and Stripe.

I've also put a lot of time and effort into the admin page, creating an intuitive and straightforward administration panel to manage our products, categories, collections, and the whole website tbh.
